# # Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to build a webpage consisting of a map and related tools by using publicly available resources and technology such as JavaScript, Map box API, leaflet js library, HTML, and CSS to complete the project.




 


By using the as JavaScript, Map box API, leaflet js library, HTML, and CSS, I was able to build various maps. The project contains three styles of base map tiles that the user can select. On top of the base tile, I layered additional data on the earthquakes using the last 7 days' data and the tectonic plate data. Both of which can also be toggled by the user against any of the 3 base maps. The data sources are pulled live in real-time from USGS earthquake data, and the tectonic plate data pulled from another user's public GitHub repo.
